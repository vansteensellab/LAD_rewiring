This folder contains the scripts that were used to generate the figures of Brueckner et al, as html with annotated code chunks and often various plots to verify the intermediate results. File names are not always intuitive, but placed in subfolders that are named according to the figures in the paper. 
The Functions subfolder contains R functions that are called by the various figure scripts. The YYMMDD date tag in the file name refers to different versions of the function set, but in principle the functions are upward compatible, thus the latest version should work for all scripts.
